## About the team 
The project was divided on Back-end and Front-end, each team has two participants and it´s the seventh project part of Laboratoria´s Bootcamp.
The Front-end team it´s integrated by Diana González Laguna and Tegthyn Coral Quiñones Gutiérrez, while the Back-end team it´s made by Lesly Zuñiga and Carmen Valencia. 

## First steps  

As we have freedom to select the users and the general lines of the cafe, we started proposing a thematic cafe, because having a most defined audience the choices of aesthetic, colors, images are way easier, at the same time the user will have a more satisfactory experience. So by voting the ones that we like most got to a list of 4 themes. To finally decide we make some personal intervews with another people to know the bes theme, and that´s how we get the space theme inspired on Interstellar film.

Once the thematic was defined we started to create prototypes, with this low definition prototype we got the concrete ideas of the diferent views of the app.
